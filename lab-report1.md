# Lab Report 1 

This is my lab report 1 - *remote access and filesystem.* 

## Part 1: Installing VScode

This is what I see after installing VSCode. In order to download VSCode, I clicked on this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/). After clicking the download button for Mac devices, I had to install packages.

Thus, upon the **successful completion** of downloading VSCode on my macbook, I see this page when I open VSCode.

## Part 2: Remotely Connecting

> In this section, I ran into errors, in which I will explain later in this section.

In attempt to connect to the server, I followed the steps to establishing a connection using my personal cs15l account. 

### STEPS:
1. As soon as VSCode loads successfully (just as like part 1), toggle on your sidebar on your macOS device. Hover over *"Terminal"* from one of the options, and click on *"New Terminal"*.
    
   > Your sidebar is found AT THE TOP of your desktop
   >
