# Lab Report 1 

This is my lab report 1 - *remote access and filesystem.* 

## Part 1: Installing VScode

![Image](vscodeview.png)

This is what I see after installing VSCode. In order to download VSCode, I clicked on this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/). After clicking the download button for Mac devices, I had to install packages.

Thus, upon the **successful completion** of downloading VSCode on my macbook, I see this page when I open VSCode.

## Part 2: Remotely Connecting

> In this section, I ran into errors, in which I will explain later in this section.

![Image](lab1ssh.png)

In attempt to connect to the server, I followed the steps to establishing a connection using my personal ucsd username ieng6 account, instead of my cs15l one. 

### STEPS:
1. As soon as VSCode loads successfully (just like part 1), toggle on your sidebar on your macOS device. Hover over *"Terminal"* from one of the options, and click on *"New Terminal"*.
    
   > Your sidebar is found AT THE TOP of your desktop. 
   > ![Image](createterminal.png)

2. After creating the new terminal, type this code block in your terminal. 
    **REMEMBER** do NOT include the $ or % sign.
   
   `$ ssh cs15lsp23__@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
   
   > replace the underscore with the last two letters, SPECIFIC to your account!

    You should receive this message from the terminal if this is the first time attempting: 
```
â¤‡ ssh cs15lsp23__@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
```
   
   In this case, type the command *yes*.
   
   It will ask for your password to your cs15l account! Don't worry about not seeing any characters pop up. The characters you type for your password will be invisible.
   
   You have successfully connected to the server if you see this message from the terminal:
   
```
Hello cs15lsp23__, you are currently logged into ieng6-203.ucsd.edu

You are using 0% CPU on this system

Cluster Status 
  Hostname     Time    #Users  Load  Averages  
  ieng6-201   23:25:01   0  0.08,  0.17,  0.11
  ieng6-202   23:25:01   1  0.09,  0.15,  0.11
  ieng6-203   23:25:01   1  0.08,  0.15,  0.11
    
 ``` 
 
  **PROCEED TO THE NEXT STEP if you see error**
  
  Otherwise, you are done with *Part 2*!
  
If you are experiencing any errors like I did, I recommend doing the following in order: 
    * double check if you typed in your password correctly!
    
   If that doesn't work, 
    * you should use your UCSD username@ieng6.ucsd.edu account. 
    > You already have the password set (the regular one to access email and tritonlink)
    
   It will work just the same, and you should be able to receive the same messages from the second step.


In my case, I had to use my ucsd ieng6 account because the remote server closed the connection on its own when I was attempting to login on my cs15l account. Thankfully, I had help from a TA, and at the end of section, I had to put down my information to request IT in order to fix my situation. I was told that it was an ADs problem, so IT will help.
    
   Hooray! You may go to part 3 and begin.

## Part 3: Trying Some Commands

![Image](lab1cmds.png)

In this part, we will be trying out some commands in the terminal. When making these commands, they will be received from your device and the remote server.

The following are the commands that I've used:

* `ls`
   
   This command in particular is known for "list". It would list all of the files and folders contained in the current directory/path
   > Output: perl5


* `ls -lat`
    
    This command is also part of the list. In addition to the ` -lat` command, it lists out all of the owners, names of the files, and dates within the current directory, including the total amount.


* `cs ~`
    
    Ignore this command. It was a typo that I made. However, something I found interesting is that my output was:
    ```
    bash: cs: command not found...
    similar commands are::
    'ss'
    'cc'
    ```
    
    > I was surprised that my output gave options of what other possible commands I could've meant


* `cd ~` or `cd`
    
    In general, the `cd` command means to change directory, and adding the `~` at the end of the command means to change the directory to the home directory. Typically, the format of this command is `cd <path>`, which changes the directory to the desired path.
    
    After using these commands in the terminal, I was surprised to find out that there were no outputs. 
    >  * I think having no output for `cd ~` means that the terminal is currently at the home directory 
    >  * As for `cd` command, the reason for not having any outputs is due to not having a `<path>` name right after.
    
    **Note**
    * Do not include the <> in your command, just use the path's name
    * Always add a space after your commands before adding any additional info


* `ls -a`
    
    As mentioned earlier, `ls` command is listing out the files. Adding the `-a` at the end of the command is for listing all of the files contained in the current directory.


* `ls /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/cs15lsp23abc`
    
    Replace the `abc` with another user's account.
    
    In particular, this command is for listing out another user's files by using the `ls` command, followed by the path from the home directory to the child directory.
    
    > I am not surprised that my permission was denied from this attempt. It would be an invasion of private property and violates privacy laws if it worked.


* `cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt ~/ ` or `cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt`
    
    The `cp` command means to copy, and the `cat` command means to print out the contents of the desired file
    > They are both followed by the path to a file.
    > 
    > However, my output showed this:
    
    ```
    No such file or directory
    ```
    
    I am not surprised from this output as this file does not exist in my account. Thus, I cannot obtain or print out the text from the nonexistent file.

If you want to exit the remote server, you can do any two of the following:

   * Ctrl + d
   * Type `exit` in your terminal

 **Thanks for following the process with me!**
